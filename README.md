# Final-project_2D-game
###### develop the mouse escaping game.
You should make a program that makes the mouse move randomly across an island (the white tiles) trying to get to safety by reaching the bridge (the green tile).
The mouse can only move one step (tile) at a time in the four main directions (right, left, up, and down).

There are four scenarios that will end the game:
- The mouse escapes: this occurs if the mouse reaches the bridge (touches the green tile)
- The mouse starves to death: this occurs if it makes more than 20 moves without escaping.
- The mouse is eaten: this occurs if the mouse meet the cat (touches the cat tile).
- The mouse drowns: this occurs if the mouse hits the water (touches a blue tile).

###### Requirements
- You should separate each functionality in your program into a function. (DONE)
- You should use Pygame to design your game board. (DONE)
- Using the keyboard keys (arrows or WASD) to control the mouse movements instead of letting the computer randomly choose his movement is a bonus. (DONE)
